# Gecko

Gecko is a **general purpose bot** which can help you moderate community and create fun.  

Games, Music and a lot of staff functions are supported.  
More functions are planned and being added.  
Use `/help` in bot for detailed help.

**NOTE** Gecko supports non-slash commands for non-staff commands only, such as games and music. Staff commands usually contain a lot of arguments and it will be very hard to use non-slash commands.
